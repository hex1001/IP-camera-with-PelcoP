This is GPL software. Do with it as you want, but feed us back any improvements.

This is a full C# classes to control a PELCO PTZ cameras, matrix switching systems, 
reciever devices and more via RS422/485 'P' and 'D' protocol. 
It supports all of the commands including UP, DOWN, IN, OUT, LEFT,
RIGHT, NEAR, FAR, as well as other extended commands. 

To use this, you need to put a RS232->RS422 adapter on the output
of your desired serial port.  

The Pelco doesn't return ANY usefull info back, so you only really need 2-wire support 
(one way) communications out.  However, I advice to read it in order to know if the command 
was recieved by the device


Have fun.
